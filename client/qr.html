                    <p class="p-disclaimer">Debt settlement is a negotiation process and therefore it is not possible to predict exact savings. Anyone considering bankruptcy should contact a bankruptcy attorney. Clients who make all their monthly program payments pay approximately 50% of their enrolled balance before fees, 65% to 75% including fees, over 18 to 48 months. Not all clients complete their program for various reasons, including their ability to save sufficient funds. Estimates based on prior results, which will vary based on specific circumstances. We do not guarantee that your debts will be resolved for a specific amount or percentage or within a specific period of time. We do not assume consumer debt, make monthly payments to creditors or provide tax, bankruptcy, accounting or legal advice or credit repair services. Our service is not available in all states and our fees may vary from state to state. Please contact a tax professional to discuss tax consequences of settlement. Read and understand all program materials prior to enrollment, including potential adverse impact of credit rating. The use of debt settlement services will likely adversely affect your creditworthiness, may result in you being subject to collections or being sued by creditors or collectors and may increase the outstanding balances of your enrolled accounts due to the accrual of fees and interest. However, negotiated settlements obtained on your behalf resolve the entire account, including all accrued fees and interest.</p>
