        <p>This Terms & Conditions Agreement is between Website users, customers and Cash KeeperFinancial, LLC (collectively herein as “Cash Keeper”, “We”, “Us” and “Our”).</p>
        <p>Cash Keeper operates cashkeeperfinancial.com, (“Website”) each with various webpages and is offered to you conditioned on your acceptance without modification of these terms, conditions, and notices contained herein (the “Terms”). </p>
        <p>Your use of this Website constitutes your agreement to all such Terms outlined here as well as Our Privacy Policy. Please read these terms carefully and keep a copy of them for your reference. </p>
        <p>Cash Keeper offers direct consumer credit lending services to individuals 18 years or older residing in the United States.  (“Services”)</p>
        <p>Cash Keeper provides consumer credit lending services under the <a href="https://www.utah.gov/dfi/ConsumerLending.html" >Utah Department of Financial Institutions</a>.  Loans are not available in all states. APR/Interest rates will vary depending on product Terms of Use. Generally, all individuals applying for credit must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident and at least 18 years old. Valid bank account and Social Security Number/FEIN are required. All loan applications are subject to credit review and approval.</p>
        <p>During the application process, you will authorize Us to make inquiries and obtain and confirm information about you as We deem appropriate for the purpose of evaluating your eligibility for this extension of credit, including obtaining credit reports, verifying your income. This process may include a “soft credit inquiry,” which doesn’t decrease your score, though you might notice it listed when you review your report. However, if you decide to move forward with a loan application after checking your rate, a “hard credit inquiry” will be initiated to validate your application details. This inquiry will appear on your report and might influence your credit score.</p>
        <p>You also authorize Us to provide identification information about you, and our credit experience information with you to others in accordance with applicable law. *Annual Percentage Rates. Not all borrowers will qualify for the same rate if a rate is listed “as low as”. Qualifying for rates listed “as low as” are based on the borrower’s credit worthiness, which includes factors such as favorable debt ratio and excellent credit history. Terms of Use apply. Interest rates will vary and may range from 4.95%-36%</p>
